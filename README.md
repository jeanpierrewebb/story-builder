# 📖 Story Builder

**Discover your authentic college application narrative**

Most students struggle to answer "What makes you unique?" Story Builder guides you through self-discovery exercises to uncover the themes, experiences, and values that define your authentic story.

## The Problem

College admissions consultants charge $3,000-$50,000 to help students find their "narrative." The core of what they do:
1. Deep reflection exercises
2. Pattern recognition across experiences
3. Theme identification
4. Positioning for essays

**Story Builder democratizes this process.**

## Philosophy

We believe in **scaffolding, not writing**. Story Builder helps you discover and articulate your story — it never writes for you. That would be:
1. Unethical
2. Detectable
3. Counterproductive

Your voice is your greatest asset. We just help you find it.
